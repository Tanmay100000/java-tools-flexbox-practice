   <h2>Spring Boot</h2>

   <section>
        <p>
          Spring Boot is a powerful Java-based framework used to build stand-alone, production-ready applications. 
          It simplifies the setup and development of new Spring applications by offering default configurations and embedded servers. 
          Spring Boot eliminates boilerplate code and makes it easy to create RESTful APIs, making it a backbone for modern Java backend development. 
          With support for microservices and smooth integration with databases, messaging queues, and cloud platforms, 
          Spring Boot is a go-to choice for backend development in full-stack applications.
